  Scenario: Switching to the estimator (I have a bill user) should display correct message on the results page
    Given I am a new user type with known postcode "Welcome!","bn126hu","I have a bill to hand","Let's go"
    Given user has selected an energy type "Gas & Electric"
    And user has selected their default energy supplier information
    When user selects the "Help me estimate" button
    When user selects their estimated usage information
      | In my house lives | My energy usage is                  | My insulation is |
      | 3 People          | Below average (professional couple) | Paper-thin       |
    Then user selects the "Usage" button
    Then user sees the route info message "As you donâ€™t have your latest usage numbers, we estimated your usage with our usage calculator."
